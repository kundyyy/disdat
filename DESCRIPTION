Description: Easy access to species distribution data for 6 regions in the world, for a total of 226 anonymised species. These data were first used by Elith et al (2006) <10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04596.x> to compare species distribution modelling methods; and have been used in several other studies as well.
